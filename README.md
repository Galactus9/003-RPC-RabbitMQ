# RPC-RabbitMQ
RPC-RabbitMQ is a repository that demonstrates the implementation of Remote Procedure Call (RPC) using RabbitMQ in C#. RPC allows a client to invoke methods or functions on a remote server and receive the results. RabbitMQ, a widely-used message broker, is used as the messaging middleware to facilitate RPC communication between the client and the server.

## Requirements
To run the RPC-RabbitMQ code, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- RabbitMQ: Make sure you have RabbitMQ installed and running on your local machine or have access to a RabbitMQ server.
- .NET SDK: You need to have .NET SDK installed on your system.


## Configuration
By default, the code is set up to use a local RabbitMQ server running on localhost. If you have RabbitMQ running on a different host or port, you can modify the connection settings
